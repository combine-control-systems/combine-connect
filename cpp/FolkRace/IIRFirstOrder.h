/**
@brief A simple first order discrete IIR filter updating output according to 
\f[y_k = au_{k-1}+by_{k-1}  \f]

It is tuned according to a single parameter x according to 

\f[a = 1-x, \quad b = x \f]

The filter dynamics depends on the sampling frequency and should be designed according to proper methods,
such as frequency domain specification. However, for quick and dirty applications x can be set experimentally. Set it closer to unity for 
"more filtering". It can be shown that for a forward Eulers discretization of a cont. first order system having the time constant Tc the paramter x is 

\f[ x = T_s/T_c = T_s \omega_b \f]

where Ts is the sampling time of the discrete system . So, if the sampling time is constand and known, the discrete filter can be specified using a time constant or bandwidth 

\f[\omega_b = \frac{1}{T_c} \f]
